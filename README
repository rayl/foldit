A set of Lua scripts to help solve Foldit puzzles.


To build a script for a puzzle (eg: 969)

    $ make 969

This will create a script named 'bin/do_969.lua'.


To use the script, you first need a recipe:

    - open the cookbook
    - create a recipe in Foldit for the script

Then, whenever the script is updated:

    - open the recipe in the editor
    - click Load
    - click Import
    - navigate to the file 'bin/do_969.lua'
    - click Save
    - click Close
    - Open the Recipe Output window
    - run the script
